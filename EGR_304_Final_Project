**<u>Introduction</u>**

Our team was assigned to create an embedded system design of an
anisotropic robot to be displayed at the Fleet Museum where observers
will be able to interact with the project and learn about anisotropic
qualities. Anisotropic properties are a valuable type of property that
can be observed in some materials today, however everyday users may not
know what anisotropic properties are, or how they can be used. Our
project is designed to be able to demonstrate anisotropic properties to
people of all ages, but primarily includes an audience of individuals
with a 5th grade reading level or higher. This means that the design
must be able to be primarily visual/tactile in nature, and allow the
user to interact with it. The design must also be robust and reliable,
as it may occasionally take drops or rough handling due to the nature of
the environment.

**<u>Establishing Our Team</u>**

***Team Charter***

Collectively we came up with some basic guidelines and a rule structure
based on the amount of effort put in per teammate given the time they
allotted for themselves that’s also based on the team schedule we
created for each other.

From that, we compiled our timetables into the team charter below and
based our accountability and enforcement rules by essentially only
giving credit where it was due. Since we’re all adults here, we felt
that it was appropriate to not have to police each other as teammate’s
and instead only really bring it to their attention when we notice a
consistent lack of contribution or progress. Also included we made sure
to not give credit to any teammate who did not take part in any of the
work at all, while also giving credit to teammates who did, by the same
measure.

As a team, we would like to be able to demonstrate anisotropic
mechanisms in a simple and easy to understand format that most ages can
understand. We hope that this project will allow each member in the
group to have a deeper understanding of embedded systems and
programming. Additionally, we also view this project as a potential
opportunity to develop new professional connections that could hopefully
help further each member's career. This will hopefully be done by
demonstrating a reliable embedded system with a high level of
repeatability, which can then be added to each team member’s engineering
portfolio.

***Mission Statement***

Our mission statement was developed based on the user needs and our
takeaways from the interviews, all combined with our goals and careers
as both students and engineers. Since we’re all from various engineering
fields of study, we came up with a single statement that meets the Fleet
Museum’s standards and needs while also representing our own.

Our goal is to create a robot that all age groups can operate easily to
demonstrate the idea of movement with certain materials (such as wood),
and its locomotion through changes in stiffness and curvature of the
object. This is called anisotropic movement.

**<u>Stakeholder</u>**<span id="shfi95a4yzfo" class="anchor"></span>
**<u>Interviews</u>**

For our user interview questions, we brainstormed as a group and picked
the five questions that we thought would offer the most insight on how
we should design our anisotropic robot. These five questions include:

1.  What parts did visitors find hard to understand?

2.  What age group visits the museum?

3.  What materials have you used before?

4.  What requirements/constraints do you have for us?

5.  In what ways does the robot need to be handled for the exhibit?

We then were able to listen to both interviews and each team member was
taking notes. All of these questions were answered during the interview
which helped us establish our basis for the project.

Once the interviews had concluded, all of the team members compiled
their notes onto a single document in which each team member selected
what they thought was important information and what answered our
questions.

Answers to the first question included visitors having a hard time
grasping what anisotropic properties are, not having an engineering or
STEM background, and some audience members being very young which could
make understanding what is going on difficult.

Answers to the second question was that all ages would be going to the
museum, but the primary age is anyone with a fifth grade reading level
or above.

Answers to the third question vary widely. Some materials were complex,
but this means that replacement in case something fails or needs repair
could be costly or hard to replace. Some materials used are very simple
and common such as cardboard, string, and flexible plastic.

Answers to the fourth question include the robot needing to be able to
fit on a conventional fold up sized plastic table approximately 3’ x 6’.
The robot must also be able to last at least two hours on a charge for
the demonstration, and should be able to handle slight drops in case of
rough use by younger audience members.

Answers to the fifth question include the robot will most likely be
demonstrated by the Fleet Museum staff, but might get slight use by the
audience.

**<u>User Needs and Benchmarking</u>**

When our team looked at user needs, we used what we gleaned from the
interviews with both the Fleet Museum staff and the researchers, as well
as looked at and came up with metrics based around kids robotics science
toys.

From the interviews themselves, we came up with 40 constraints based on
each interviewer’s response to the questions and ranked them from 1 to 3
from least to most important. From there we took the highest ranking
constraints and put them into a Google Jamboard and compiled them
together into a Venn diagram to determine what are the most necessary
things that we need to look for when designing a robotic exhibit for the
Museum.

We also chose and benchmarked three separate but related kids robotics
toys that focused as much as possible on locomotion and modular
construction with anisotropic components. We listed these 40 needs
bellow:

***User needs***

1.  Needs to be powered by a rechargeable battery if possible. Rank 2

2.  Needs to be able to run for 2 to 4 hours at a time. Rank 3

    > about STEM. Rank 3

24. Needs to have low energy level motion, kid safe. Rank 3

25. Needs to use school craft material (glue, construction paper,
    > cardboard, pipe cleaners, etc.) Rank 2

26. Needs to move under its own power, no outside forces. Rank 3

27. Needs to be able to run for 10-15 minutes at a time; expected
    > exhibit time. Rank 3

28. Needs to be modular, preferably. Rank 1

29. Needs to not have sharp edges or exposed wires; anything harmful to
    > children. Rank 3

30. Needs to be made of pliable, soft materials that can bend and twist.

33. Needs to be an enclosed device, like a robotic muscle section. Rank
    > 1

34. Needs to be able to be understood by anyone. Rank 3

35. Needs to have instructions and warning for workers. Rank 3

36. Needs to use a Micro Controller. Rank 2

37. Needs to use different sensors. Rank 2

38. Needs to be engaging. Rank 3

39. Needs to be able to see results. Rank 2

40. Sensors need to have no board to control it, and must build them as
    > a student if needed. Rank 1

With these ranked constraints, we benchmarked five products below, and
analyzed user reviews of each, to determine the positive and negative
aspects of them. With these aspects, we used the terms ‘latent’ or
‘explicit’ with each review we went through. Latent, in this case, means
that the aspect is not immediately apparent and is not clearly defined.
Explicit, on the other hand, means that the issue or aspect is clearly
visible and apparent.

This was a good first benchmark for what we were planning on creating,
however we wanted our design to be easier for kids and adults to play
with so that it won’t fall apart. Since children’s toys can and do get
easily broken from rough play, we wanted our design to be robust and
easy enough to play with so that there are no parts that could break off
or get swallowed, and also handle being dropped or thrown. We also
wanted the design to not have to be pre-assembled by museum-goers so
that they can take it and set it up and have it be ready to go right
away.

Solar panels were not considered in our design since the exhibit is
indoors, but this kit is where we came up with the idea of longevity for
our robot. The Solar Robot has multiple build options, and we wanted our
robot to do different things like this without having to be rebuilt each
time. This was where we explored the idea of it moving differently based
on the orientation of the unit, and which way the motors move. This way
we can have our robot do different movements right away without having
to reassemble it.

The Makeblock mBot gave us an idea of how we wanted to set up our code.
Since our robot is meant to teach people about anisotropic robotic
movement and not coding, we wanted to make sure that our coding was
airtight and not overly complicated. No extra coding or programming was
what we wanted, so that when activated, the robot performs its action
and stops when it’s turned off. We also gained insight on how we needed
to make our robot easy to figure out and operate, and not require any
extra software like the mBot.

Again what we found out from this kit is that we did **not** want to
have a robot that has to be assembled before being used at the display.
We wanted our robot to be simple, and easy to work with for our target
audience. This meant that instructions, function, and the unit itself
had to be simple and fun, while being functional and easy to understand.
People can easily be engaged with our design and have fun with it for a
few hours with their families and kids.

Looking at the STEM Kit, we came closer to figuring out what it was that
we wanted out of our design. The problem again though was,
unfortunately, that parts are hard to handle for kids, and the quality
of the materials is bad. Therefore we wanted to have our robot be made
of good quality materials, like malleable and soft bits that aren’t
likely to cause injury. Finally we wanted it to be as fun and engaging
for kids as possible so as to hold their interest for long periods.

**<u>Product Requirements</u>**

Our team listed out all the needs that we gained from the interviews we
conducted with the researchers and with the fleet museum. Based on the
information and needs we gathered we were able to come up with our
Product Requirements. Our product requirements are safety of museum
visitors and workers, use of a microcontroller with no computer
attached, demonstrate anisotropic properties, and run for two hours or
more in a single session.

Our team will assess each of our requirements throughout the course of
creating our final product at each step of the process. To meet the
requirement of safety, we will check that our product does not use high
voltage in our design, as well as not including any sharp edges. For
using a microcontroller and not having an attached computer, our team
will use a PSoC controller. For being able to demonstrate an anisotropic
property, we based our ideas around including at least one anisotropic
property from the beginning so that way they will be included in each
step. For maintaining two or more operation hours we can accomplish this
with the use of rechargeable batteries.

**<u>Design Ideation</u>**

Each team member played a crucial role in generating ideas for the
project. Each member listed off at least 25 individual ideas, concepts,
or features that could do with the project. Then, each member selected
their 3 favorites, where they were all compiled and the team voted on
which three to further pursue in the design ideation phase. This type of
brainstorming worked since there were so many individual things to
choose from, versus before when we tried to come up with full-fledged
ideas and struggled on the small details. Tyler Winder invented and
sketched the first two concepts, and William Drubka created and modeled
the third and final concept.

<img src="media/image33.png" style="width:6.56771in;height:3.69434in" />

**<u>Figure 9. Design Ideation</u>**

We started with one hundred ideas and threw them basically at the wall,
metaphorically speaking. Although not visible very well from the sheer
amount of ideas we devised during this process, we used colors to show
who was picking what out of their ‘idea salad’ to be used in the next
step, which was another Venn diagram shown below.

<img src="media/image9.png" style="width:4.85938in;height:2.96875in" />

**<u>Figure 10. Design Ideas grouping</u>**

Here, we took the ideas that we found most pertinent out of the one
hundred that we came up with and placed them into groups, ranked again
by color. The factors we used to decide on an idea were: fun, safe, and
feasible. Feasibility in this case pertains only to our team and the
Fleet Museum for the scope of this project. With these ideas in mind, we
developed three concept designs for what our robotic exhibit could look
like.

<img src="media/image19.png" style="width:3.83771in;height:3.62711in" />

**<u>Figure 11. First Concept Idea</u>**

This design makes use of rubber segments that contain wire that shrinks
when a current is passed through it. These wires control the shape of
the segments and which way they can bend. By stacking these segments on
top of each other and controlling which way they bend they make a
robotic octopus-like arm.

<img src="media/image10.png" style="width:4.47396in;height:2.54329in" />

**<u>Figure 12. Second Concept Idea</u>**

This idea was based on the fins of a fish. The robotic fin shown above
is made of hard plastic rods that are connected by a soft flexible
membrane. By bending the different rods to stretch the membrane it
allows for movement in one direction but not the other.

<img src="media/image30.png" style="width:3.79167in;height:4.21618in" />

**<u>Figure 13. Third Concept Idea</u>**

This idea was based on the side to side slither of a snake. For this
concept, we have 5 total separate body pieces that are all connected via
hinges and a thin plastic strip. This strip creates the anisotropic
properties which allow movement in the horizontal direction, but not the
vertical direction, keeping the snake on the ground. The middle body
piece has motors and spools attached which rotate and wind string or
fishing line that is connected to the outermost pieces, causing the
movement to occur.

**<u>Selected Design</u>**

We chose the anisotropic snake design for our robot. It presented the
most versatile design out of all of the designs we conceptualized
towards the beginning of the project. Since the main goal is to make a
robot that shows off the applications of anisotropic movement with
stiffness and curvature, we figured what better way to do that based on
our constraints than with a moving snake robot?

The reason we chose this over the other designs was because we
discovered that they may have been too complicated for children and
adults at the museum to easily operate. We wanted to go with something
simpler with less buttons and joysticks. We want our design to be simple
and fun, and also durable. Our other designs raised too many concerns
over breakage and potential safety hazards, and therefore the snake
ended up being our safest, most simple, and most fun design that we
decided to stick with.

<img src="media/image11.png" style="width:4.67815in;height:3.3972in" />

**<u>Figure 14. Top view of the final design</u>**

<img src="media/image27.png" style="width:4.77652in;height:3.3972in" />

**<u>Figure 15. Bottom view of the final design</u>**

Since we wanted to make our design semi-autonomous (capable of moving on
its own without much intervention), we wanted to make our software
follow a loop of code that would bring the snake to a motion and then
back to a starting point repeatedly at the push of a button. This way it
allows museum goers to not have to baby the robot or ask for assistance
constantly in order to get it to work, this way it lets everybody have
fun and see the applications of anisotropic movement with minimal
issues, aside for the potential of having to replace batteries, which is
common in other toys and devices for kids, and doesn’t get in the way of
displaying the science behind this movement.

**<u>Block Diagram</u>**

After deciding on the project concept our next step was to create the
block diagram that shows every team member’s subsystem for the project
as shown below:

<img src="media/image12.jpg" style="width:4.19995in;height:4.90185in" />

**<u>Figure 16. Final Block Diagram</u>**

The block diagram shows four different subsystems connected to the micro
controller that is being controlled by bluetooth. The four subsystems
are the pressure sensor, distance sensor, motor controller, and voltage
regulator. The system is controlled by receiving feedback from the
sensors and controlling the motor accordingly to move the snake.

**<u>Component selection</u>**

After deciding on our design concept and the subsystems we needed to
build it as shown in the previous block diagram. It was time to select
the components that will be used to build our subsystems. The component
selection process was done by searching for different components and
comparing them to assure we have the best component for our project. The
following tables will walk you through the different components that we
had and how the choices were made.

**Choice:** QSE-113 & QED223

**Rationale:** Since all of the options chosen were daughter boards, we
went with the ‘building our own distance sensor’ idea instead. For this
we chose the QSE113 infrared receiver and the QED223 infrared emitter.
We used these to build our own distance sensor subsystem circuit which
we decided to use in place of the daughter board sensors.

**Choice:** Option 1: Walfront9snmyvxw25 FSR

**Rationale:** The one that we chose for the pressure sensor is the
Walfront pressure sensor. We chose this one because it is small enough
to fit on our product without preventing it from moving. It is also the
cheapest out of the options that we found and it comes with two so that
we can have a backup in case something goes wrong.

**Choice:** Option 1: AutoToolHome JYCRS390H 6-12V Mini DC Motor

**Rationale:** We decided to choose option 1 for the motor as it is the
simplest option. In my opinion, we do not need a very high torque motor,
or a very high speed motor. A simple option seems ideal as it is a
familiar platform from earlier in the class, and we plan to control it
with an FAN8100N H-bridge circuit integrated with the PSoC
microcontroller. There is no datasheet provided with this motor, but
there are detailed specifications and they are inexpensive and readily
available.

**Choice:** Option 1:5V 1.5A Linear Voltage Regulator - 7805 TO-220

**Rationale:** The 5V 1.5A linear voltage regulator seems to be the best
option we found because not only it is the cheapest but it is also the
most efficient. The second option can be replaced by a variable resistor
to change or control the speed of the motor. It does also handle more
watts without burning more than the third option.

**Choice:** Option 1: FAN8100N H-Bridge Motor Driver

**Rationale:** We decided to choose option 1 for the motor driver as we
all have previously used the FAN8100N H-Bridge in class so it is a
familiar choice. It is a simple motor driver to use, and should supply
enough current to the motors as needed. We plan to use two for our
robot.

***Powering the circuit***

After selecting the components that will be used for building our
project we completed the following [<u>power budget
sheet</u>](#kix.e7qofkq4zd3t) using the max voltage and current from the
data sheets of the components and doing the calculation for the battery
life. We were originally planning to use rechargeable batteries to power
up our robot but then we saw that it would be safer to use the 9V, 3A
wall adapter that was given in our kits at the beginning of the class.
We saw it would be better not to use the battery because we were
concerned about the weight of the battery and the voltage output to drop
below 7V which is the minimum voltage required for the voltage regulator
to output clean 5V.

**<u>Hardware proposal</u>**

Our next step was to create a [<u>bill of materials</u>](#4f3o4k1dok8r)
then building a schematic to put all of our selected components together
in one system. The figure below shows the schematic of our circuit that
will control the anisotropic snake’s motion.

***Schematic:***

<img src="media/image28.png" style="width:6.5in;height:4.48611in" />

**<u>Figure 17. Schematic design</u>**

In the above schematic you can see that all of the subsystems that were
designed and tested by each team member are all now connected and
controlled by the microcontroller (Psoc). The first part which is on the
top right is a barrel jack that will receive 9v 3A and then cut it to 5v
using the voltage regulator which meets the voltage required to power
the psoc and the motors. Next we have the distance sensor that will
measure the distance using Infrared emitter and receiver and then the
signal will be amplified by the op-amp and then will be sent to the
microcontroller. Next we have the pressure sensor which will measure the
pressure and then the signal will be amplified and sent to the psoc.
Lastly we have the motors and the H-bridges that will control the motion
of the snake.

***PCB Design***

<img src="media/image36.png" style="width:4.00521in;height:3.10404in" />

**<u>Figure 18. PCB Top layer</u>**

<img src="media/image6.png" style="width:3.95346in;height:3.10706in" />

**<u>Figure 19. PCB Bottom layer</u>**

This is our pcb design. We managed to fit everything in less than
10x10cm pcb. This is our front and back layers . The front layer is our
5v connection and the back layer is the blue layer which is our ground.

<img src="media/image34.png" style="width:6.36458in;height:4.839in" />

**<u>Figure 21. PCB Top view in the components soldering process</u>**

<img src="media/image17.jpg" style="width:3.06771in;height:2.31061in" />

**<u>Figure 22. PCB Bottom view</u>**

As we can see in the figures above this is our final pcb the power is
going to be inputted from the barrel jack and regulated to 5v then feed
the circuit. We have our two H_bridges and motors on the right side of
the psoc. We had a problem in the motors connection footprints so we had
to connect the motors directly on the H_bridge pins. On the left we have
both of our pressure and distance sensors subsystems. We had the
pressure sensor and the IR receiver and emitter to be connected by
jumper wires so we could put them in their places on the snake. As we
saw in the snake design the pcb will be placed on the top and control
the two motors that will be tied with the tails to give the isotropic
motion to satisfy the user needs for this project.

***Potential improvements in the Hardware system***

If we were to make version two of our hardware system we would add many
safety and debugging components. This system worked at the end but we
burned two psoc chips in the process. That is why adding fuses and
debugging LEDs would have prevented that from happening. As for the
debugging LED it would help us better and faster debug our code as it
was challenging when we combined all of our subsystems code together. We
would have also changed the motors footprints and added extra connection
to the psoc pins in case of damaged traces which happened in one of our
traces. We would also increase the trace width to make the debugging
process easier in case it was damaged. Also we had many issues with the
distance sensor using the IR emitter and receiver so we were thinking of
using ultrasound instead of infrared to measure the distance. Lastly we
would add extra connection points in case the trace got damaged so we
can easily connect components with wire if needed.

**<u>Software Proposal</u>**

Our software follows a fairly basic logical progression from the time
the robot turns on, to when it finishes one full cycle of motion. In
figure 23 below, we show how the robot will behave step-by-step from the
moment that power enters each subsystem, which type of code will be run,
and how the robot’s activity loops until it is turned off via switch.
Figure 23 is a broad and basic description of the logical progression.
The final Psoc code can be found [<u>below</u>](#y0pw1gkztr5h).

<img src="media/image21.png" style="width:2.96875in;height:5.63203in" />

**<u>Figure 23. Software logic flow chart</u>**

What this looping does is it causes our snake robot to locomote itself
across the display table by contracting and extending, creating a smooth
theoretical motion. While we still need to go through actual physical
testing phases, we’re confident that this progression of steps will
produce the desired results for our chosen design. What we plan to have
it do is, someone turns on the robot with a button or a switch, the
snake robot extends and contracts to locomote itself across the table,
being able to be moved around by hand as it does so, and then comes to a
stop once the button or switch is turned off. In this way it shows how
anisotropic movement is possible in a flexible robotic limb or an arm,
like a muscle.

Numbered list of changes since the proposal:

1.  Added a single loop to code, instead of multiple loops.

2.  Removed the check if the voltage was good.

3.  Added a connection to bluetooth.

4.  We made sure the blocks were correct in our above diagram.

5.  We added an end to the code so that it does not go on forever.

For the first change having multiple loops causes some issues with one
allowing one loop to be activated at a time. This caused the sensors to
be delayed in sensing the environment. The second change was due to
being redundant because the psoc will turn on when it has the correct
voltage. The third change was that we did not have it in our first
software proposal. The last two changes we made was to make our code
more readable and organized.

***Potential improvements in the Software system***

If we were to make a version 2.0 of our software proposal, we would
change the way the motors moved. We would do this by adding a PWM to
change the speed of the motors. The motors in our final design were
getting too much power from the psoc code that it caused the lines to
get tangled. Adding a PWM would slow down the motors to a speed that
would prevent the line from getting tangled, but still allow the motors
to have enough speed and power to move our product. We would also add a
better timer into our code so that the sensors are always reading. Since
in our plan the code only allowed for the sensors to detect at the start
of the loop, meaning that the sensors had to wait for the motor to
perform their full loop of motion before they would be active again. In
our final code we made it so that the sensors would detect every
nanosecond. Another thing that we could do better is move the motor
movement control into its own function. This will make the main function
small and easier to read. The last thing that we would change would be
the bluetooth capabilities of our code. In our final psoc code we had
the pressure sensor tied to stopping the motors. With being able to get
the bluetooth working fully we would be able to send data from the
pressure sensor to the user’s phone so that they may be able to read
that data.

**<u>Lessons learned</u>**

1.  The PSoC units that are handed out can be very finicky. Sometimes
    > something as simple as running code or wiring up a different PSoC
    > can cause problems, since we had a lot of units burn out or not
    > function upon receival during the semester.

2.  Pre-soldering power and ground wires makes things a lot easier to
    > make good connections later in the semester, since it saves a lot
    > of time and hassle trying to hook things up correctly.

3.  Fishing line is not necessarily the best material to use for the
    > spools as it tends to get tangled with itself. Wire management is
    > also very important for a robot that has lots of moving parts as
    > we had several instances where the fishing line got tangled with
    > some of our leads or loose wires, damaging the robot which made us
    > have to make repairs. We believe a lot of these issues can be
    > solved with auto-tensioners on the spools to reduce slack, as well
    > as a different pulley material such as a much softer string or
    > rope.

4.  Timer loops can be useful instead of using Cydelay as it results in
    > the code being more efficient, as well as allows the rest of the
    > code to still execute instead of just staying idle. This is useful
    > when you have actuators or motors waiting on a sensor to provide a
    > certain signal to tell them to start or stop.

5.  Getting initial tests of perfboard / protoboard subsystems completed
    > early on is essential as one subsystem not working can delay the
    > entire project from being built or finished.

6.  PCB board manufacturing in Peralta is not always the most reliable
    > form of manufacturing, and defects can occur, which leads to the
    > PCB not functioning properly. Debugging of these defects can take
    > a lot of time, so it is important to verify all subsystems on the
    > PCB as soon as possible.

7.  Using PWM for controlling the motors gives us more control over the
    > movement of the device then just using fully powered and not
    > powered.

8.  Creating a housing unit for the PCB is a good idea if the device has
    > moving parts. That way the moving parts have a harder time pulling
    > out wires and components.

9.  Checking the footprint of components with both the data sheet and
    > personal measurements before creating the PCB prevents any errors
    > of making the footprints too big or too small.

10. Creating enough debugging LEDs makes debugging the code much easier
    > to accomplish as they provide one of the only ways to test
    > individual sections of the code.

**<u>Recommendation for future students</u>**

1.  If you have any prior wiring or breadboarding skills, brush up
    > **heavily** on those. This is Embedded Systems Design. Be prepared
    > to spend several days debugging and troubleshooting faulty circuit
    > connections and coding. There are a LOT of individual
    > breadboarding assignments. Make as much use of the teaching team
    > and tutoring as well as online help as possible.

2.  Similar to number one, if you do not have prior knowledge or
    > experience in writing code in C, again, make use of as many
    > helpful resources as possible. Be prepared to make use of nearly
    > everything in each assignment that you do, because it all blends
    > together at the end, where you need to make a functioning robot
    > with your team.

3.  Address **any** **issues with teammates** **early on in the
    > semester**, because it will get in the way extremely quickly. Be
    > ready to try to solve conflicts and issues ASAP because they will
    > hinder you immensely in this class if they aren’t resolved as soon
    > as possible. If there are teammates not doing work or causing
    > problems, **immediately** bring it up with them, and if they don’t
    > listen or respond, take it to the professors.

4.  This class is **extremely work intensive**, be ready to set aside
    > other work or classes on your priority list to make time for this,
    > because assignment due dates come up really fast and often. Be
    > ready to devote most of your time to this class, because there is
    > a **lot** of work.

5.  If you are struggling or stuck on a concept, circuit, coding, etc.
    > **Talk to someone right away!** You are part of a team, and we’re
    > all in the same boat. Do not hesitate to ask for help, and get as
    > much as you can get, because you will get overwhelmed if you get
    > stuck and don’t. The aides and the professors are very helpful and
    > will address problems as soon as they can. Make use of every
    > available resource, as said prior.
