# About me

My name is Tyler Winder and I am currently a dual major in electrical and software engineering. I have been a part of the National Honor Society for two years now, and have consistently made the Dean's List for the past two years.

I am a very hardworking and determined individual. As if this wasn't enough, I am also a black belt in Karate, an Eagle Scout, and I spent two years of my life as a Church Service Missionary in Buenos Aires, Argentina.
