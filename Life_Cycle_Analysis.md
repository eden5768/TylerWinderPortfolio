Team 11 - Life Cycle Analysis

No mistakes were made on Team Assignment 4. We are skipping this prompt.

**Goal and Scope Definition**

Goal and scope statement: The main goal of this LCA is to determine the
impacts of our two products (plastic toy and book) on the environment.
All lifecycle stages will be evaluated, including the non-recycling
alternative of the resin immediately being disposed of or being released
into the environment uncured. Based on this LCA, we plan to adjust our
production model to be as sustainable and efficient as possible.

For our interactive product, a plastic toy, this is a cradle-to-grave
production model. Because our produce is a thermoset and cannot be
recycled after its use in our product, this product will be sent to the
grave at the end of its life and will not be reused again.

For our educational product, a book, this is a cradle-to-cradle
production model. The book is recyclable and we will inform our users to
recycle the product at the end of its life.

**Impact Assessment**

**Material 1: Resin**

In addition to its own footprint, resin is also responsible for the
footprint of other materials required to safely handle it, such as paper
towels and latex gloves. The gloves are analyzed below. The respective
footprints of all of these items must be added to the base footprint of
the resin to get a more accurate estimate for this material.

1.  The water footprint of resin is approximately 28 gallons of water
    > per pound. To calculate the water footprint, we would multiply the
    > weight of our final product, plus the weight of our leftover
    > resin, by 28. Note, however, that our product uses resin that was
    > already on its way to being thrown out - the resin was not
    > produced for the purpose of our project.

2.  Resin production emits approximately 86 kg of carbon per kilogram of
    > resin. We would therefore multiply the mass of all resin used by
    > 86 to determine the carbon footprint of our product. Note,
    > however, that this resin was already produced and on its way to a
    > landfill when we procured it - this resin was not produced for use
    > in our project.

**Material 2: Paper**

1.  The water footprint of paper is 2-13 liters per A4 sheet, depending
    > on the type and location of wood used in production. This accounts
    > for a small percentage of paper being produced through recycling.
    > For our estimates, we will use an average of these two values, or
    > 7.5 liters per piece of A4 paper. To calculate this footprint, we
    > will multiply the number of pages used by 7.5 liters.

2.  The water footprint of paper is 5869 pounds of carbon per 400 reams
    > of paper, simplified to 0.029345 lbs per sheet of paper. To
    > calculate the carbon footprint of the amount of paper used, we
    > will multiply this number by the number of pieces used throughout
    > our project.

**Material 3: Latex gloves**

1.  Manufacturing latex is a water-intensive process. Natural latex is
    > almost 70% water and must be dehydrated. In the process, the latex
    > is washed in hot water, cured within water solutions, and tested
    > for defects by being filled with water. To determine the water
    > consumption of this product used in our design, we would find the
    > amount of waste-water a latex glove factory disposes of and divide
    > this by the number of gloves they produce. This would be the water
    > footprint of one glove. We would then multiply this by the number
    > of gloves used to create our product, which was 28.

2.  The worst carbon impact of latex is actually cultivating latex, not
    > manufacturing the raw material into gloves. To determine the
    > carbon footprint of the gloves used in our design, we would find
    > the volumetric carbon emissions of a latex plant (from growth
    > through manufacturing) and divide this by the number of gloves
    > they produce. This would be the carbon footprint of producing one
    > glove. We would then multiply this by 28.

**Interpretation and Understanding**

We cannot become so focused on repurposing this waste resin that we
create more waste throughout the production process, negating any
positive effect. The most concerning is the need for latex gloves,
plastic sheets, and other materials to safely handle the resin
throughout the curing process, all things with their own footprints and
negative impact. We must streamline this portion of our production
process for efficiency in order to truly make our product a positive
impact on sustainability and the environment.
